                <h4>Uptown Manhattan</h4>
                <h3>NEW-YORK</h3>
                <p>Much of Manhattan was formed during the little ice age 15,000 years ago. Stevie Wonder and James Brown got their start at the Apollo Theater. Ulysses S. Grant and Bono from U2 have made it their home. Central Parkâ€™s meadows and mountains. Hills as steep as San Francisco. Mansions within blocks of brownstone walk-ups. It will all stun you!</p>

                <h4>Downtown Manhattan</h4>
                <h3>NEW-YORK</h3>
                <p>The largest Chinatown outside of Beijing. 1892 style cannolis in Little Italy. The posh designer shopping of SoHo. Harbor views and the seaport. The hip bohemian landscape of the village. The man made canyons of Wall Street. A somber reflection at Ground Zero. More than enough memories to last a lifetime.</p>

                <h4>Brooklyn</h4>
                <h3>NEW-YORK</h3>
                <p>Almost 3 million people who live in Brooklyn, the hippest part of NYC, must be doing something pretty darn interesting. Not to mention the architecture, history, art, food and fun contained in this massively diverse borough of New York City. Graffiti art to Egyptian mummies. Pizza perfection and meat in tube form (hot dogs) that defy comparison.</p>
